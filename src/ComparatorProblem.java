/**
 * Problem Statement
 *Comparators are used to compare two objects. In this challenge, you'll create a comparator and use it to sort an array.
 *
 * The Player class is provided for you in your editor. It has 2 fields: a name String and a score integer.
 *
 * Given an array of n Player objects, write a comparator that sorts them in order of decreasing score; if 2 or more players have the same score, sort those players alphabetically by name. To do this, you must create a Checker class that implements the Comparator interface, then write an int compare(Player a, Player b) method implementing the Comparator.compare(T o1, T o2) method.
 *
 * Input Format
 *
 * Input from stdin is handled by the locked stub code in the Solution class.
 *
 * The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of players.
 * Each of the n subsequent lines contains a player's name and score, respectively.
 *
 * Output Format
 *
 * You are not responsible for printing any output to stdout. The locked stub code in Solution will create a Checker object, use it to sort the Player array, and print each sorted element.
